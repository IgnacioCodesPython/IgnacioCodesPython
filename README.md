## Welcome
Hello! I'm *@IgnacioCodesPython*. I love making new **Python** projects, because it's the most fun programming language of all time to me.
## Social media
I only have a YouTube channel. The link is down below.

## Proving my knowledge
Over here, i'll prove how much i know **Python**.

I'll just show one from here, but i'll go on and prepare myself weekly and daily for making a new **Ignacio Python** challenge, where you'll have to comment the answer to the question before time runs out and to show more of my knowledge.

But, i'll just repeat that routine 5 times, that means i'll be doing this for 5 weeks, but the **Ignacio Python** challenges will still go daily.

If you don't feel that a new Ignacio Python challenge is posted on YouTube and alerted here on Github, that means that i'm probably at school, making some storage on my phone for it to let me record, or maybe i'm busy working from coding.

With that out of the way, let's prove my knowledge in **Python**!

```python
class Brand:
  def __init__(self, brand):
    self.brand = brand
  def __str__(self):
    return f"This is {self.brand}."
  def drivecar(self):
    return f"The car from the brand {self.brand} is driving!"

car = Brand("Olee")

print(car)
car.drivecar()
```

## Logging off
Okay, bye! This is it for now. Bye-bye!

Oh! Also forgot to tell you, that i have a playlist of my new series: **Ignacio Teaches**!

You can also see them separatly in my channel's videos. I only have the **PSeInt** and **Mobile** editions, but the next edition will be the **Python** one.

Finally, bye.
